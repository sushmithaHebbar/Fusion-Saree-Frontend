Saree Fusion Design Studio

Overview

The Saree Fusion Design Studio is a responsive web application built with React that showcases a modern, vibrant user interface focused on custom Indian saree design concepts. The application features a dynamic, mobile-first design with an emphasis on rich visuals and real-time theme switching.

Key Features

Dynamic Theme Switching: Users can toggle between Light Mode (default) and Dark Mode using the moon/sun icon in the header. The primary color palette (Orange, Red, Gold) dynamically adjusts for high contrast in both modes.

Custom 3D Carousel: A pure React/CSS implementation of a 3D, center-active carousel that automatically advances and loops through design examples with smooth visual transitions.

Hero Section: A dedicated, full-width section with a strong visual and call-to-action (CTA).

Design Workflow: Dedicated views (UploadView and ResultView) simulate the process of uploading design elements (Body, Pallu, Border) and generating fused design results.

Themed Footer: A streamlined, responsive footer containing key links and a prominent CTA, fully integrated with the application's color theme.
